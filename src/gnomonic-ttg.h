    /*! \brief Equirectangular tile to rectilinear transform
     * 
     *  This function performs a gnomonic projection of an equirectangular tile
     *  extracted from an entire equirectangular mapping. The obtained 
     *  rectilinear image can have an arbitrary size taking into account that
     *  scaling of pixels is set through focal and pixel length, assumed to be 
     *  identical in both direction.
     *
     *  In order to perform the desired transformation, the following 3d-frame
     *  is  attached to the entire equirectangular mapping from which the tile
     *  is  extracted : the x-axis points the left edge of the mapping at half
     *  height. The y-axis points at third fourth of the mapping width and at
     *  half of its height. The z-axis is obtained using a cross-product, 
     *  inducing a direct frame in which the mapped sphere is considered.
     *
     *  The computed rectilinear image has its center attached to the x-axis and
     *  the image plane is orthogonal to this same x-axis. The rotation matrix,
     *  that ensure desired mapping part selection, is built as follows : 
     * 
     *      M = Ry(Elevation) Rz(Azimuth) Rx(Roll)
     *
     *  and corresponds to the rotation that brings the rectilinear image pixels
     *  on the equirectangular mapping.
     *  
     *  The input equirectangular tile has to be a three or four chromatic 
     *  layers bitmap and the output rectilinear bitmap has to be already
     *  allocated according to its parameters and has to come with three or four
     *  chromatic layers. The bitmaps are standard bitmaps that considers byte
     *  padding in memory.
     *
     *  When input equirectangular bitmap comes with an alpha channel, it is used
     *  do define pixels mapping transparency. If the output rectilinear bitmap
     *  is allocated with an alpha channel, the projected alpha channel of the
     *  mapping is written in the rectilinear alpha channel.
