    /*! \brief Equirectangular mapping rotation

     *  This function allows to rotate the equirectangular mapping keeping the
     *  sphere it maps unchanged. The result is drawn in the output bitmap that
     *  has to be already allocated according to its parameters.
     *
     *  The rotation is performed considering the following frame : the x-axis
     *  points the left edge of the mapping at half height. The y-axis points at
     *  third fourth of the mapping width and at half of its height. The z-axis
     *  is obtained using a cross-product, inducing a direct frame in which the 
     *  mapped sphere is considered.
     *
     *  The three angles defined rotation matrix is built as follows :
     *
     *      M = Ry(Elevation) Rz(Azimuth) Rx(Roll)
     *
     *  and is then used to rotate the mapping of the sphere.
