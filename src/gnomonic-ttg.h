    /*! \brief Equirectangular tile to rectilinear gnomonic projection
     *  
     *  This function performs an gnomonic projection considering a tile of an entire
     *  equirectangular panorama using the desired interpolation method. The results
     *  are drawn in the lgRectOut bitmap. The lgRectOut has to be already allocated
     *  according to its parameters.
     *  
     *  \param lgEqrIn Pointer to equirectangular tile bitmap
     *  \param lgEqrWidth Width, in pixels, of the equirectangular tile bitmap eqr_img
     *  \param lgEqrHeight Height, in pixels, of the equirectangular tile bitmap eqr_img
     *  \param lgEqrLayer Depth, in chromatic layer count, of the equirectangular tile bitmap eqr_img
     *  \param lgRectOut Pointer to gnomonic bitmap
     *  \param lgRectWidth Width, in pixels, of the gnomonic bitmap rct_img
     *  \param lgRectHeight Height, in pixels, of the gnomonic bitmap rct_img
     *  \param lgRectLayer Depth, in chromatic layer count, of the gnomonic bitmap rct_img
     *  \param lgPanWidth Width, in pixel, of the entire equirectangular mapping
     *  \param lgPanHeight Height, in pixel, of the entire equirectangular mapping
