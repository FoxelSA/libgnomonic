## libgnomonic<br />Gnomonic projection algorithms library

This library is developed to perform gnomonic projections from a entire equirectangular mapping of spherical panoramas to extract rectilinear mappings. It also ensure gnomonic projections of specific tiles of equirectangular mappings to obtain rectilinear mappings from single tiles. Each provided projection algorithm comes with an implementation of its inverse operation. The library also provides equirectangular transformation algorithms.
